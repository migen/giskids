#1 - notes


what if i want a simple 2 to 5 max tables, but as few joins if ever as possible yet most optimized for performance like search and filtering notes or todos system for my own organization and esp for my self use, with some of the features now i can think of


- shareable to share_user_id, or share_group_id, so automatically if not shared to anyone, it means private to the user_id (created_by) 
- simple mvp schema fields but valuable and useful esp for simple ui and app to be deployed in live prod server
- it handle any info like contacts info, schedules like meetings, calendar events, transactions data, to be like one stop information system for myself, then if not 
- can have admin panel, filter, search, sort, etc
- what name of system to call this, todos, notes, information, or what? please help me as this might be the core system of my entire personal information system or personal erp system for myself and my corporation, thanks
